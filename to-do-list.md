Turned out I didn't do well in last 2 days. I spent a lot of time reading news about US politics. This was hugely wrong. From now to next Saturday, I shouldn't read any news about US politics!!! When I feel sleep or tired and want to relax, I can watch videos online. 

From today on, I should really focus 30% on leadership principle questions, 40% on system design, and 30% on coding.

My life has been a total mess. In the past 2 days, I spent a lot of time reading news about US politics. This was so wrong! In next week, I should not spend any time reading news about US politics at all. I think I will make it.

## 22/1/24
Yesterday I spent about half an hour reading news about US politics. Today I spent around one hour. This was terrible. Tomorrow and Wednesday I should not spend any time reading news about US politics. It has nothing to do with my life.

Today I should have stories written for all the major topics of leadership principle questions. I should have a quick look at system design questions that I am not familiar with but my appear.

Today I should also practice at least half the questions that I should memorize. 

## 23/1/24
Today I also spent an hour reading news about US politics. This was super wrong. I can't tolerate this behaviour anymore! This week I must not read any news about US politics. No matter what happens to US politics, my life will still be the same.

From tomorrow to Friday, what I should do:
1. Practice leadership principle questions 2 times
2. Practice common system design questions twice
3. Learn algorithm questions twice as well

Starting tomorrow, I should get up at 6am in the morning. And if I am tired in the day, I should have some coffee. In the worst case, I can watch some funny vidoes. But remember, I shouldn't read any news about US politics.
