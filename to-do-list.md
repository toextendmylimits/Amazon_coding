# Things to do in next 7 days until 24 Jan
1. Don't check any news about US politics
Don't spend any time with something that is not relevant to my life.
2. Get up at 6am every day
3. Check at 5 system designs every day
4. Read at least 5 LP questions every day
5. Look at 20 leetcode questions every day and hopefully be able to review all the major topics one more time

## 18/1/24
Turned out I didn't do well in last 2 days. I spent a lot of time reading news about US politics. This was hugely wrong. From now to next Saturday, I shouldn't read any news about US politics!!! When I feel sleep or tired and want to relax, I can watch videos online. 

From today on, I should really focus 30% on leadership principle questions, 40% on system design, and 30% on coding.
