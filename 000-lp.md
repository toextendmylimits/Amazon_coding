## Achivements
1. Most difficult project you worked on?  
    Situation: 
    The most difficult project I worked on was to rebuild our legacy system of order book trade. The legacy system was designed 20 years ago using old technologies. It had quite a few issues such as that it's very hard to maintain the system and adding new functionality turns out very challenging and time-consuming. So I was tasked to lead a team of 10 people including software developers, testers, business analysts and business developers to rewrite the legacy system.
    
    Task:
    The project had a few chanllenges. First one was to understand clearly how the existing system works and come up with detailed business requirement. Given the system was very old, and people who originally worked on it had left, and there was hardly any documentation, hence no one had a comprehensive understanding of the system. The second challenage was to have a good design so the system could be maintained and extend easily in the future. And the third one is to really lead the team and finish the project successfully within the deadline.
    
    Action:
    To understand how existing system works, I communicated with all the relevant parties who had bit of knowledge of it, and wrote the requirement down in a shared workspace, and then asked them to review as well. It was not an easy process. I had a lot of meetings and sometimes I also spent time in testing how a certain functionality worked. After a few weeks a clear and detailed business requirement was written and the team had a shared understanding of it as well. 
    
    Then I did an investigation into the technologies and came up with a roboust design, which utilized micro service architecture and springboot framework to improve productivity and increase scalibility. And the design was also well documentated for future reference.
    
    Finally I divided the project into many smaller tasks and assigned them to others based on their skills, experience and interests. I worked with the team, tracked the project progress and updated the management team frequently. 
    
    Result:
    After 1 year's hard work, the project finished successfully within the scheduled time. Although the code change was tremendous, the system had very few issues since it went live into production. And the system was much easier to maintain and extend. If fact, not long after the project finished, it only took just several weeks to add a major new functionality which would normally need a few months. That funcationlity increased our revenue by 30% and made our cutomsers very happy as well.
