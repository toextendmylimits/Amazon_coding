# Leadership principles
## Achivements

1. Rebuild orderbook application.  
   Questions: Most difficult project you worked on?
   
    Situation:   
    The most difficult project I worked on was to rebuild a legacy application. The legacy application that was developed 20 years ago using old technologies. As a result, the appliation was very hard to maintain and to extend. Adding new functionality turned out very challenging and time-consuming. So I was tasked to lead a team of 8 people including developers, testers, and a business person to rewrite the legacy application to keep the most existing functionalites and adding a few new functionalites. 
    
    Task:  
    The biggest challenge was to understand the business requirement. Given the legacy application was 20 years old, and many people who originally worked on it had left, and there was hardly any documentation, hence no one had a comprehensive understanding of the application.
   
   The second challenage was to have a good design so the system could work well in the future.

    And the third one is to really lead the team to finish the project within the deadline.
    
    Action:  
    To understand how existing application works, I communicated with all the relevant people from various teams who had bits of knowledge of it including business team, market operation team and development team, and wrote the requirement down in a shared workspace, and then asked them to review as well. I also spent a lot of time in checking how the existing application worked as well by testing and looking at the code directly. After a few weeks a clear and detailed business requirement was written and the team had a shared understanding of it as well. 
    
    Then I did an investigation into latest technologies and came up with a high-level design that utilized micro service architecture and springboot framework to improve productivity. I also made sure the design was clearly documentated in details so future developers could understand it easily.

    Finally I set a few major milestones, divided the project into many smaller tasks and worked with the team. I also tracked the project progress on a daily basis and made sure the blocking issues were resolved quickly and the project was on track.
    
    Result:  
    Eventually the project finished successfully. Although the code change was enormous, the appliation had very few issues since it went live. And some new functionalities were also well received by the clients and as a result the revenue increased by 10%. 


## Insist on highest standards
   Described a time you refuse to compromise on the standards? What was the result?

## Delivery Results
   Worked on tight deadline  
   
   Situation:  
   I have faced quite a few instances in my career where I have had to work to tight deadlines. However, one occasion that particularly stands out was during my tenure as a Lead Software Developer at my previous organization. We were working on a major product luanch but midway through the project, our senior management maded the difficult decision to move the deadline up by a few weeks, due to change of the market condition. This left us with significant amount of work to complete in a much shorter time frame.

   Task:
   So the challenge was how to finish the work within the deadline.

   Action:
   To tackle the challenge, I did a few things.
   
   Firstly, I sat down with the team and re-evaluated our project timeline. It was essential for everyone to understand the situation we were in and the new expectations. I then strategically prioritized the tasks based on their impact on the project, identifying which tasks could be done concurrently and which tasks were dependent on others.

   Secondly, I identified several developers from other teams that could help the project based on their experience and skillset. Then I asked the management to allow them pause what they worked and helped on the project for a while and the request was approved.
   
   Thirdly, I discussed with the team and suggested to put in some extra hours each week. I explained to the team that no one liked working overtime, but this was really needed in such a critical time. So all the team members agreed to put extra hours every week. I ensured that this was done on a rotational basis to avoid burnout and maintained an open line of communication for any team member to express concerns or issues.
   
   After this, I implemented a more rigorous daily check-in to keep track of the project’s progress. This not only helped in identifying any potential roadblocks early but also ensured that everyone was aligned on the project status and the tasks they were responsible for. 
   
   Simultaneously, I kept the management informed of our progress. Transparency was crucial, so we made sure to provide regular updates, reassuring them that we were doing our utmost to meet the revised deadline.

   Result:  
   Eventually, I was able to lead the project to completion on time without compromising on the quality of our work. It was a very challenging period, but it underscored the importance of strategic planning, effective communication, and teamwork when working under tight deadlines.


## Have Backbone; Disagree & Commit; Disagree and commit
1. Disagree with project delivery approach big bang vs incremental change  
 
   Situation:  
   When I worked on a major functionality for bonds products, which were the most important oens for the platform, I disagreed with the business people about the approach about how the project should be worked on. Business people wanted the changes to be done in a big bang approach. I strongly disagreed with this approach because I believed the risk was too high. Instead I thought incremental change was better.
   
   Tasks:
   So the task I have was to discuss with business people and find the the right approach for .
   
   Actions:
   I did a few things. 
   
   Firstly I clearly mentioned the risks that were involved with big bang approach
   The change was very complicated and it touched many different applications as well. As a result, the regression imapct was very big. Although we did a lot of testing, but it just couldn't cover everything so the likelihood of some existing functionalities were broken was high from development and testing point of view. And the consquences would be very significant if some major functionalites were broken. For example, derviative products which generated quick a lot of significant revenue could be broken. If there were serious issues, not only the revenue would be affected, but the reputation of our company as a trading platform would be damaged and we could potentially have some legal problem as well. 
   
   Then I explained the incremental approach, and proposed to work on the project in three major stages:
   1. In the first stage, we had the system functionalities behind feature toggles, and released it with the functionalities turned off. This would help to find some regression issues and fixed accordingly.
   2. In the second stage, we released changes for bond products which were less important, such as inflation linked bonds as there was not much trading. This was to make sure the main funcionality worked and we could also collective useful feedback from clients and then made improvement.
   3. In the third stage, we released the system for our most important products, government bonds.
   
   The incremental approach not only great reduces the risk, but also have quicker visible progress and hence improve the team morale as well.

   Result:
   In the end, the business people were totally onboard with the approach of incremental change. The functionaliteis were developed in multiple stages and released to production successfully with very few issues. The busissess people saw the benefits of this approach and asked other teams to follow this approach as well since then.

1. Disagree with coding standard  
   Situation:
   I once noticed some problems of code not being clean when performing the code review. The code was not formatted well such as there was not spaces between operand and operator, and one line if statement were not enclosed with brackets, code was duplicated, etc. I advised the person to change accordingly but the person disagreed.
   
   Tasks:
   So the task was to discuss with that person and find ways to improve the code.
   
   Action:
   I clearly explained the principles of clean code and why they were important, referencing the industry standard code guideline as well, such as the Google code style guide. For example, having proper spaces would make the code much easier to read. Having brackets around one life if statement would make the code easy to maintain as the code would still work if in the future someone adds a new line for the if statement. Encapsulating duplicated code would make the logic clear, and it can be reused easily as well in the future. 
   
   Then I suggested to configure the development tool IDE to have automatic code formatting so no need to worry the issue such as not having proper spaces at all. And I suggested to have linting tool installed as well so it can detect some potential code issue for refactoring. For example, it can defect code duplication and suggest to encapsulate the logic into a small function.
   
   I also took the chance to propose giving a presentation to the much wider development team to raise awareness of principles of clean code.
   
   Result:
   Finally my manager agreed with me, changed the code accordingly and approved me to give a presentation to the much wider development team. And the presentation was well received and they were happy to follow the principles of clean code. A month later, we reviewed the code commits from various developers and found that the code quality improved significantly, with code formatting issues decreased by 50%.

1. Disagree with whether developers should write unit test and conduct thorough manual testing as well  
   Situation:  
   Several years ago I noticed that there was a tendency to neglect testing for developers in the team. When developers worked on a new fuctionality or fixing a defect, there was not much unit test or automation test, and there was no clear evidence that developers did enough manual testing either. I was a big believer that developers should be responsible for the quality of their code include testing the code as well, before handing over to the quality assurance team or testers. The management thought developers could focus on the delivery and let testers test the functionality more thoroughly as it would be time-consuming for developers to write unit test, automated end-to-end tests, or tested the functionality throughly.
   
   Tasks:  
   I strongly disagreed with the status quo and tried very hard to persuade the management to realize the importance of having more test from developers.
   
   Action:  
   I firstly explained the importance of unit test. Unit tests could catch defects early in the release process. It can also improve code quality and facilitate refactoring in the future. For example, when some code is refactored, if a unit test fails, then likely some existing functionality is broken and should be fixed accordingly. Unit tests can also serve as a documenation to help developers understand the code. I used existing code as an exmaple and provoided some unit tests to show how it would help us. 
   
   I then explained the importance of manual testing by developers. I mentioned that developers should write clear test scenarios and put evidence of what tests were conducted as well. That way testers can look at the test scenario and test evidence, and may focus more on the scenarios that were not tested thoroughly instead of testing everything blindly, which would be very time-consuming and ineffective in finding defects. 
   
   Result:  
   The management was finally persuaded and asked developers to try this new approach of writing unit test code and conducting manual test and documenting testing evidence as well to see how it worked. After a few weeks, the feedback from the developers were that the found the overall code quality improved, and there were less pushbacks from testers for rework. For testers, the time required to verify a fuctionality for bug-fix decreased by roughly 30%. So the management saw the benefits and hence formally asked all developers to follow this process from then on and we never looked upon.


## Failures
1. Missed a deadline
   Situation:  
   I recall I once missed a deadline during early days of my career. Back then, I worked extremely hard and was often overly eager to go to the extra mile. Then I was asked to lead a small team to work on a feature for one of our clients. It was my first time leading a project, so I was very keen to  prove myself. However, I neglected the fact that the client had very high expectiation and went on to set a very unrealistic deadline to please the client without even consulting other team members.  In fact, I completely miscalculated the time needed to complete the project. I also failed to predict different complexities along the way. Although I pushed the team really hard, soon it became very clear that the project couldn't be finished within the deadline.
   
   Task:
   So the challeage was how to really finish the project.
   
   Actions:
   I took some actions. 
   Firstly, I had a meeting with the team and admitted it was my fault for the project delay and I asked the team to discuss a more realistic project deadline.  I did a root cause analysis with the team and identified bottlenecks by reviewing the project timeline and checking the main dependencies between tasks. I then worked with the team to make some very realistic estimates to the remaining tasks together, considering some unforseen contigency as well. I also asked each person to voice their concerns or issues. Then I came up with a new timeframe to finish the project, which turned out to be a few weeks longer than the original one.
   
   Secondly I communicated with the client openly, expressed the situation, apologized for the project dealy, and admited now the project couldn't be finished within the deadline, and asked the client to approve the new deadline. The client was not very happy with the delay, but showed understanding of the situation, and agreed to extend the project deadline. 
   
   Result:  
   Finally the project was finished with a few weeks later than the orignal deadline.  The situation was not ideal but it helped me improve my planning skills and distribute tasks in a more efficient way, and this experience also taught me just how crucial it was to have ressonable estimation, and set realistic expectation, so to avoid over promise but under deliver. I also learned the importance of teamwork and open communication. Luckily, I learned from my mistake and it never happened again.
      
## Are right a lot Decisions
1. Tell me about a time that you have to make a decision between standard and delivery?
   
   Situation:    
   There was once a time that we had a production issue that a few products had wrong effective dates and termination dates. It caused one of our largets clients to have done some wrong trades which needed to be revoked. The client was very unhappy and asked the company to solve the issue ASAP.  I was asked to look into the issue and find a fix. I quickly found that these products were generated by the system roughly every three months and the core logic was flawed and hence the system could generate wrong dates from time to time. Ideally these logic of calcuating dates should be fixed so the issue would never appear again. However, that was not easy as the logic was very complex and undoubtedly would take much more time, and involed more risk as well. 
   
   Task:  
   So I was thinking what shall I do? To spend more time to come up with a solution that fixes the rootcause or have a short-time workaround to fix the issue temporariliy first at least? What happened in the past was often times when a issue was fixed by a workaound, it was forgotten and the underlying issue was not fixed, and hence caused grief in the future. For example, at some point, the issue might appear again. So back then, our company had a standard of avoding quick dirty workaround if possible.
   
   Action:  
   After careful consideration, I proposed to have a short-term workaround to fix the issue first, by amending the dates stored in database and then did a system start to pick up the changes. Although this was not a great solution, it solved the problem for roughly 3 months hence could make the client feel much better and avoided futher reputation damage to the platform.
   
   I also created a task to fix the issue more properly by fixing the flawed the logic of generating dates, and asked the management to prioritize the task to be worked in the near future so we didn't forget about it like before. 
   
   Result:  
   The management agreed with my suggestion. So I went on to fix the issue by provoding the workaround and released it in just two days. The client was very pleased with the quick turnraoud. A few days later I was also able to fix the flawed logic of dates generation so the dates would never be wrong again, not only for these products, but also for many other products which shared same logic for generating dates. What I learned sometime it was okay to lower the standard a little bit for quick delivery to address urgent issue but be sure to make change to maintain the standard later so to avoid cuasing issues down the track.

## Customer
   How to deal with a difficult customer

   Situation:
   When I worked for my previous company, one of my team member deployed some changes to a development environment for testing. However, one of our very senious business person was using that environment to do a DEMO to one of our very important clients in a different city. The deployment totally disrupted the DEMO. The business person was very angry understandbly.

   Task:
   So as leader of my team, I needed to calm down the business person and more importantly to find a solution to prevent the issue from happening again

   Actions:
   I did a few things.

   First I tried to calm down and not took things personally. Then I apologized to the business person for the disruption although I knew it was not that developer's fault as we were not notified that there was a DEMO using development environtment. Normally development environments were just reserved for testing by development team.

   Second, I mentioned that given clients DEMO could happen very often, it was better to have dedicated environments for that purpose and no developer should deploy change to these environments until approval from business people. I acknoledged that there were still times that business people needed to use a development environment to show some latest functionalities. So I created a simple web portal where business people can reserve some environments for a period of time, then the relevant team would received notifications in email, and would double check with the business people, and then avoided doing any change to these environments during that time.

   Result:
   The business people agreed with the approach  
   
## Bias for action
A time where you’ve taken a calculated risk where speed was crucial? What was the situation? How did you handle it? What steps did you take to mitigate the risk? What was the outcome? Knowing what you know now, would you do something differently? 

1. Solved production quickly

   Situation:  
   We once had a urgent production issue in a morning that our clients couldn't trade in some markets. I was asked to lead a team to look into this and find a fix urgently. I first had a meeting and gave a brief on the issue and then asked each team members to check different areas. Not long after, I found the rootcause. The issue was caused by mis-configuration. The fix was simple but quite a few applications need to be restarted to let the change take effect. When applications restarted, potentially other markets could be affected as well.

   Task:  
   So the challenge was shall we release the change mid of day or wait until end of day when market was closed?

   Action:  
   Apparently it would be safe if we wait until end of day, but with every minute passed by, the company lost some revenue, and more importantly, suffered a bit more  reputation damage. To help make a better decision, I wanted to find out what was the effect to restart different applications. I identified the applications that we needed to start, and based on the dependency between applications, the relationship between different instances of a application, I defined orders of how application should be started. For example, if application A depended on appliation B, application B should be restarted first. Or if an application had both primary and secondary instance, we restarted the secondary instance first. Then I wrote a quick test plan about what markets and high-level functionalties each person should test. Then I restarted the applications and tested witht he team in an environment and found that the whole process was pretty quick and there was no issue at all. Although there was still risk that things didn't work well in production,  the likelihood was not very high. So I suggested to take this calculated risk to apply the fix in production immediately instead of waiting until end of day.

   Result:  
   Witha approval from senior management, the fix went to production soon. Turned out it was very successful as the urgent production issue was fixed and no new issue was introduced in the process either. Our clients were pleased with the quick turnaround. And the company avoided losing more revenue or suffering more reputation damange.
   
1. Use new way to panic which deviate from how it worked before  
   
   Situation:  
   When I worked on a project to add a new product to our system in my previous organazation, I maded the panic funcitonality worked differently with other existing products. We had the panic functionality for existing products to let trader quickly remove own orders or all the company's orders for certain products when there was extreme market volatility, like when price moved sigfinicantly. If a trader wanted to panic own order, he or she can click on the panic button once. To panic orders for his or her company, the trader needed to click the same panic button again. I found this very hard to use. 
   
   Task:  
   So I wanted to really improve this functionality.
   
   Action:  
   I took a few actions. 
   
   First, I explained why I thought the current way the panic functionality worked was terrible. When sometimes the system was slow and not very responsive, even the user just wanted remove own orders, but could accidentally click the panic button a few times and caused unwanted effect of removing company's orders. And in general, it was not a good practice anyway to separate different UI events by how many times a same button was clicked.
   
   Then I proposed a new solution instead, to have a centralized menu which had a separate menu for each panic behaviour. If user wanted to panic for self,  he she just need to click on menu "panic own orders". If user wanted to panic for the company, the just needed to click on menu "panic company orders". This way not only more clear, but also easier for supporting new panic behaviours in the future. For example, if we wanted to let trader panic manual orders for a company, we just needed to add a new menu.
   
   The business people was persuaded and approved the new approach. To mitigate the risk, I also asked to demonstrate the new functionality to some of our clients to see their feedback. Turned out they were happy with the new approach. Even though there was still risk that some clients might not like it, I mentioned it was worth to give it a try and change accordingly later.
   
   Result:  
   Luckily, when the new way of panicking products were released to production, our clients liked it very much, and asked to use this approach going forward in the future.

## Dive deep
   Tell me a time you tried to understand the complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out. who did you talk with or where did you have to look to find the most valuable information. how did you use the information to help to solve the problem?

## Invent and simplify
Question: A time where you solved a complex problem with a simple solution  

1. Invented a new way for database migration which boosted team productivity and morale

   Situation:
   When I joined my previous company a few years ago, I noticed the process of database migration was a quite manual and tedious one. We had various databases for different environment from UAT, DEMO to production etc., and each developer could have a few databases as well for different tasks. Each time when there was a database change, it needed to be applied manually by executing the SQL scripts directly to other different databases as wellso they can be in sync. Not only this was quite slow but also it was very error-prone. For example, a SQL script could be applied twice. Although the other developers who had worked there alreday complained about this as well, some of them were kind of used to it and no one really attempted to solve the problem. 

   Task:
   As a new comer, I was really not happy with this status quo and I was keen to find a more simple and efficient way for database migration. 

   Action:
   I explained the problem to my manager and mentioned the issue would getting much worse with more environments being added and more developers joining the company later and if left unchecked, the issue would not only decrease developer's productivity significantly but also affected the team morale a lot. I told my manager that I would like to spend some time to find a better solution and the request was approved.

    Then I did a lot of investigation and found liquibase a open-source libarary for tracking, managinging and applying database changes. Liquibase defined database changes in various format that were familar and comfortable to developers, SQL, XML, JSON at etc. The changes could be in a code reposotory hence could be tracked easily. So I integrated Liquibase with our CI/CD tool Jekins, tested it a few times against different environments and found it worked really well. When there was database change, it should be pushed to our code repository, and then other developers can use the CI/CD tool Jenkins to trigger the job for database migration, and it would finish normally in 2 or 3 minutes. And if a database change had been applied, it would be recorded in a separate database table for change history, and next time when running Jenkins job again that database change would be skipped.

    Then I formalized the process for database migration, clearly documenated it so it can be followed easily, and gave a DEMO to fellow developers showing how database migration can be done easily using this new process and they were very impressed.

   Result:  
   As a result, the team agreed the new approach for database migration was much better and fully adopted to it.  Several weeks later, I asked feedback from other develoeprs, and found that on average 4 hours were saved for each person a week. Since then on, the new process for database migration became the standard for the team. 
1. Improved release process  
   Situation:  
   A few years ago, I noticed the release process in our company was becoming less effective. We had more than 20 applications and for each application, it had several instances running on different linux servers. And for each application, there was a separate CI/CD tool Jenkins to package the application and move the files to the linux servers, and the release also involved a manual step of executing commands on the different linux servers to restart services to avoid that people accidentllay restarting the service. As you can imagine, it would be very time-consuming to release all these applications and in fact it could take 4 hours or sometimes even a day for a developer. More importantly, this manual process was very error-prone as sometimes people forgot some steps. Many people was not happy with the release process but not person took the initiative to solve the problem.
   
   Task:  
   Having witnessed the inefficiency of the release process for a while, I really wanted to improve it and explaind the situation to the management and hence got approval to spend some time on it.
   
   Actions:  
   I did an investigation and checked what was the latest industry standard for release process. I found it was very common to have automatic release process using some CI/CD tool like Jenkins and Jenkins offered powerful solution for automating software delivery processes. I spent a few days creating a Jenkins pipeline script which allowed to package all or some of the applications and then deploying them in one go. To avoid the risk that people accidently triggering the release process, I made some configuration change so that only a few senior people were granted permission to view and trigger the Jenkins job to release to production. For others, the permission can be granted on a need basis. I then tested the new release process in a testing environment for several days and later I proposed the release process to the wide team.
   
   Result:  
   The team including the management were very impressed and the team formally adopted the new release process. It turned out the release process worked very well . It reduced the time people spent on releasiing changes to production by 3 hours per release, and in the meantime mitigated the risk of human error.

## Ownership
   Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?

   Situation:
   When I worked for my previous organization, I once noticed the system had issues on a Sunday evening at 8pm. The background was different teams restarted the system on Sundays on a roational basis to make sure the system was in a good state. My team was not on duty that Sunday at all. However, as a habit, I stilled check the chat messages from the work group. Then I noticed the developer who was on duty that Sunday posted a few issues and he was not sure what to do. He asked for help in the wider developers group and even tagged the CTO but there was no response from any person. Likely most of people were still enjoying the weekends.

   Task:
   So I was thinking shall I move on and not worry about it at all and let that developer and the team he or she was in to take care of the issues given it was their responsibilities?

   Action:
   Without hesitation, I decided to help the developer. I was not at my home then so I quickly drove back home and turned on my computer. I called the developer and offered to help. The developer was clearly struggling and was really happy knowing that I wanted to help him. I asked him to talk all the issues he found and what his investigation was. Then I looked into them. Soon I found that most issues were just false alarm as they happened before evidenced by historial logs so could be safely ignored. There were few remaining issues. I couldn't find what was wrong exactly and suggested to restart the relevant applications. Turned out restarting applications sovled these issues as well. 
   
   Result:
   As a result, the system was healthy again at 9pm Sunday and ready for Monday's trading. Without my help, these issues would take much longer to be solved, which would put trenmenous pressure to the developer, his team and the management. In the worst case, if the issues were still not sovled on Monday morning, then our company would be in real big trouble. 
   
   To improve the process, I also made suggestion to move the system restart time from Sunday evening to Sunday morning so to leave enough time for contigency and the suggestion was approved by the mangement.
