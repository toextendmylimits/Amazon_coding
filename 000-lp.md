## Achivements
1. Most difficult project you worked on?
Situation: 
The most difficult project I worked on was to rebuild our legacy system of order book trade. The legacy system was designed 20 years ago using old technologies. It had quite a few issues such as that it's very hard to maintain the system and adding new functionality turns out very challenging and time-consuming. So I was tasked to lead a team of 12 people including software developers, testers, business analysts and business developers to rewrite the legacy system.

Task:
The project had two big chanllenges. One is to understand clearly how the existing system works and come up with detailed business requirement. The second challenage is to design a system that works well. And the third one is to really finish the project successfully within the deadline.

Action:
To understand how existing system works, I communicated with all the relevant parties who had bit of knowledge of it, and wrote the requirement down in a shared workspace, and then asked them to review as well. It was not an easy process. I had a lot of meetings and sometimes I also spent time in testing how a certain functionality worked. After a few weeks a clear and detailed business requirement was ready. 

Then I did an investigation and came up with a design. I proposed a few technologies:
1. To add a caching layer between applications and database to improve system performance. 
2. To use the latest modern UI framework AngularJS which makes UI development much easier
3. To have a micro service architecture to improve productivity and increase scalibility

Finally I divided the project into many smaller tasks and assigned them to others based on their skills, experience and interests. I chaired the meetings and tracked the project progress and updated the management team frequently. 

Result:
After 1 year's hard work, the project finished successfully within the scheduled time. Not only the new system had very few issues but also the system was much easier to maintain and extend. If fact, not long after the project finished, it only took a few weeks to add a new functionality which increased revenue by more than 30%.
