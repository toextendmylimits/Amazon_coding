# Leadership principles
## Achivements
1. Rebuild legacy system.  
   Questions: Most difficult project you worked on?
   
    Situation: 
    The most difficult project I worked on was to rebuild our legacy system of order book trade. The legacy system was designed 20 years ago using old technologies. As a result, it was very hard to maintain the system and adding new functionality turns out very challenging and time-consuming. So I was tasked to lead a team of 10 people including software developers, testers, business analysts and business developers to rewrite the legacy system.
    
    Task:
    The project had a few chanllenges. First one was to understand clearly how the existing system works and come up with detailed business requirement. Given the system was very old, and people who originally worked on it had left, and there was hardly any documentation, hence no one had a comprehensive understanding of the system. The second challenage was to have a good design so the system could be maintained and extend easily in the future. And the third one is to really lead the team and finish the project successfully within the deadline.
    
    Action:
    To understand how existing system works, I communicated with all the relevant parties who had bit of knowledge of it, and wrote the requirement down in a shared workspace, and then asked them to review as well. It was not an easy process. I had a lot of meetings and sometimes I also spent time in testing how a certain functionality worked. After a few weeks a clear and detailed business requirement was written and the team had a shared understanding of it as well. 
    
    Then I did an investigation into the technologies and came up with a roboust design, which utilized micro service architecture and springboot framework to improve productivity and increase scalibility. And the design was also well documentated for future reference.
    
    Finally I divided the project into many smaller tasks and assigned them to others based on their skills, experience and interests. I worked with the team, tracked the project progress and updated the management team frequently. 
    
    Result:
    After 1 year's hard work, the project finished successfully within the scheduled time. Although the code change was tremendous, the system had very few issues since it went live into production. And the system was much easier to maintain and extend. If fact, not long after the project finished, it only took just several weeks to add a major new functionality which would normally need a few months. That funcationlity increased our revenue by 30% and made our cutomsers very happy as well.

2. Invented a new way for database migration which boosted team productivity and morale

   Situation:
   When I joined my previous company a few years ago, I noticed the process of database migration was a quite manual and tedious one. We had various databases for different environment from UAT, DEMO to production etc., and each developer could have a few databases as well for different tasks. Each time when there was a database change, it needed to be applied manually to other different databases as well so they can be in sync. Not only this was quite slow but also it was very error-prone. Although the other developers who had worked there alreday complained about this as well, some of them were kind of used to it and no one really attempted to solve the problem. 

   Task:
   As a new comer, I was really not happy with this status quo and I was keen to find a more simple and efficient way for database migration. 

   Action:
   I explained the problem to my manager and mentioned the issue would getting much worse with more environments being added and more developers joining the company later and if left unchecked, the issue would not only decrease developer's productivity significantly but also affected the team morale a lot. I told my manager that I would like to spend some time to find a better solution and he approved. So I did a lot of investigation and found liquibase a open-source libarary for tracking, managinging and applying database changes. Liquibase defined database changes in various format that were familar and comfortable to developers, SQL, XML, JSON at etc. The changes could be in a code reposotory hence could be tracked easily. And the change could be applied to database using auto deployment tools like Jenkins. I tested this new approach for database migration and it worked well.


   Result:  
   After a week, I formalized the process for databse migration. Then I gave a DEMO to fellow developers showing how database migration can be done easily using this new process. They were very impressed. The team agreed this was a much better way for database migration. So I clearly documentated how to follow the new process and the team fully adopted to it. Several weeks later, I asked feedback to other develoeprs, and they said on average at least 4 hours were saved for them a week. So to summarize, I noticed a problem which affected developer's productivity significantly, and took initiative to invent a simple yet very efficient process which increased productivity a lot.

3. Migrated our system from Java 8 to Java 11
Situation:
Several years ago I was tasked to migrate our system from Java 8 to Java 11. The project had a very tight deadline becasue the support to Java 8 from our linux operating system would come to an end in three months hence we wanted to get the migration done before that. 

Challenge:
We had roughly 30 micro services running and Java 8 and migrating them all to Java 8 would have a very big regression impact and need thorough testing to make sure no major functionality was broken.


## Disagree and commit
1. Disagree with project delivery plan  
   Situation:
   When I worked on the project to rewrite our system for orderbook trading of bonds, I disagreed with the business people about the delivery approach. We had bonds products and the most important ones for the company were government bonds and business people wanted the system to be deployed in a big bang approach and then worked for bonds straight away. I disagreed with this approach because I believed the risk was too high and I suggested to release the system in several stages instead.
   
   Tasks:
   So the task I have was to discuss with business people and find the the right approach for delivery.
   
   Actions:
   I did a few things. 
   
   Firstly I clearly explained the risks that were involved:
   1. The system was super complex and it touched many different applications and the likelihood. Although we did a lot of testing, but it just couldn't cover everything so the likelihood of something functionality was broken was high from technical point of view
   
   Then I mentioned the consequences of having something broken. Govenment bonds were the main products on our platform and generated the most revenue for our company. If there were serious issues, not only the revenue would be affected, but the reputation of our company as a trading platform would be damaged and we may potentially have some legal problem as well. 
   
   So I proposed to release the system in three major stages to control the risk and have rapid delivery as well:
   1. In the first stage, we had the system functionalities behind feature toggles, and released it with the functionalities turned off. This was really to make sure there was some regression impact.
   2. In the second stage, we released the system for a not so important products, inflation linked bonds. This was to make sure the main funcionality worked because the inflation linked bonds worked very similarly to government bonds.
   3. In the third stage, we released the system for our most important products, government bonds.
   
   Result:
   In the end, the business people agreed with me on the delivery approach. The system was deliverred successfully to production in multiple stages and no major issues were introduced. The team was really happy with this approach of having functionatility behind feature toggles and delivering to production more rapidly, and different teams were advised to follow this approach as well.

1. Disagree with coding standard
   Situation:
   I once noticed some problems of code not being clean when performing the code review. The code was not formatted well such as there was not spaces between operand and operator, and one line if statement were not enclosed with brackets, code was duplicated, etc. I advised the person to change accordingly but the person disagreed.
   
   Tasks:
   So the task was to discuss with that person and find ways to improve the code.
   
   Action:
   I clearly explained the principles of clean code and why they were important, referencing the industry standard code guideline as well, such as the Google code style guide. For example, having proper spaces would make the code much easier to read. Having brackets around one life if statement would make the code easy to maintain as the code would still work if in the future someone adds a new line for the if statement. Encapsulating duplicated code would make the logic clear, and it can be reused easily as well in the future. 
   
   Then I suggested to configure the development tool IDE to have automatic code formatting so no need to worry the issue such as not having proper spaces at all. And I suggested to have linting tool installed as well so it can detect some potential code issue for refactoring. For example, it can defect code duplication and suggest to encapsulate the logic into a small function.
   
   I also took the chance to propose giving a presentation to the much wider development team to raise awareness of principles of clean code.
   
   Result:
   Finally my manager agreed with me, changed the code accordingly and approved me to give a presentation to the much wider development team. And the presentation was well received and they were happy to follow the principles of clean code. A month later, we reviewed the code commits from various developers and found that the code quality improved significantly, with code formatting issues decreased by 50%.
