## Achivements
1. Rebuild legacy system.
   Questions: Most difficult project you worked on?
   
    Situation: 
    The most difficult project I worked on was to rebuild our legacy system of order book trade. The legacy system was designed 20 years ago using old technologies. As a result, it was very hard to maintain the system and adding new functionality turns out very challenging and time-consuming. So I was tasked to lead a team of 10 people including software developers, testers, business analysts and business developers to rewrite the legacy system.
    
    Task:
    The project had a few chanllenges. First one was to understand clearly how the existing system works and come up with detailed business requirement. Given the system was very old, and people who originally worked on it had left, and there was hardly any documentation, hence no one had a comprehensive understanding of the system. The second challenage was to have a good design so the system could be maintained and extend easily in the future. And the third one is to really lead the team and finish the project successfully within the deadline.
    
    Action:
    To understand how existing system works, I communicated with all the relevant parties who had bit of knowledge of it, and wrote the requirement down in a shared workspace, and then asked them to review as well. It was not an easy process. I had a lot of meetings and sometimes I also spent time in testing how a certain functionality worked. After a few weeks a clear and detailed business requirement was written and the team had a shared understanding of it as well. 
    
    Then I did an investigation into the technologies and came up with a roboust design, which utilized micro service architecture and springboot framework to improve productivity and increase scalibility. And the design was also well documentated for future reference.
    
    Finally I divided the project into many smaller tasks and assigned them to others based on their skills, experience and interests. I worked with the team, tracked the project progress and updated the management team frequently. 
    
    Result:
    After 1 year's hard work, the project finished successfully within the scheduled time. Although the code change was tremendous, the system had very few issues since it went live into production. And the system was much easier to maintain and extend. If fact, not long after the project finished, it only took just several weeks to add a major new functionality which would normally need a few months. That funcationlity increased our revenue by 30% and made our cutomsers very happy as well.

3. Invented a new way for database migration

   Situation:
   When I joined my previous company a few years ago, I noticed the process of database migration was a quite manual and tedious one. We had various databases for different environment from UAT, DEMO to production etc., and each developer could have a few databases as well for different tasks. Each time when there was a database change, it needed to be applied manually to other different databases as well so they can be in sync. Not only this was quite slow but also it was very error-prone. Although the other developers who had worked there alreday complained about this as well, some of them were kind of used to it and no one really attempted to solve the problem. 

   Task:
   As a new comer, I was really not happy with this status quo and I was keen to find a more simple and efficient way for database migration. 

   Action:
   I explained the problem to my manager and mentioned the issue would getting much worse with more environments being added and more developers joining the company later. If left unchecked, the issue would not only decrease developer's productivity but also affected the team morale. I told my manager that I would like to spend some time to find a better solution and he approved. So I did a lot of investigation and found liquibase a open-source libarary for tracking, managinging and applying database changes. Liquibase defined database changes in various format that were familar and comfortable to developers, SQL, XML, JSON at etc. The changes could be in a code reposotory hence could be tracked easily. And the change could be applied to database using auto deployment tools like Jenkins. I tested this new approach for database migration and it worked well.


   Result:  
   After a week, I formalized the process for databse migration. Then I gave a DEMO to fellow developers showing how database migration can be done easily using this new process. They were very impressed. The team agreed this was a much better way for database migration. So I clearly documentated how to follow the new process and the team fully adopted to it. Several weeks later, I asked feedback to other develoeprs, and they said on average at least 5 hours were saved for them a week. So to summarize, I noticed a problem which affected developer's productivity significantly, and took initiative to invent a simple yet very efficient process which increased productivity a lot.
