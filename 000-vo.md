# These are from virtual on-site questions
## Questions which are either from leetcode or different source but description is very clear
1. [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome)
2. [409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome)
3. [1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/analyze-user-website-visit-pattern)  
   The problem can be divided into three tasks:
    1. Use a hash map to store user and visited websites sorted chronologically
    2. For each user, find all the combinations of 3 websites, and remove duplicates to get the patterns, and update pattern's counter
    3. Loop through the counter, find the pattern with maximum frequency. Beware if multiple patterns have maximum frequency, return the smallest one
    Complete code is as follows:
    <details>

     ```python
     from collections import defaultdict, Counter
     import itertools
     
     def mostVisitedPattern(username, timestamp, website):
         userSitesMap = defaultdict(list)
         for user, timestamp, site in sorted(zip(username, timestamp, website), key = lambda x: (x[0], x[1])):
             userSitesMap[user].append(site)
         
         counter = Counter()
         TUPLE_ELEMENTS = 3
         for user, sites in userSitesMap.items():
             for pattern in set(itertools.combinations(sites, TUPLE_ELEMENTS)):
                     counter[pattern] += 1
         
         maxFreq = 0
         result = None
         for pattern, freq in counter.items():
             if freq > maxFreq:
                 maxFreq = freq
                 result = pattern
             elif freq == maxFreq and pattern < result:
                 result = pattern
         return result
     
     username =["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"]
     timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
     website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
     print(mostVisitedPattern(username, timestamp, website))
     ```

## Not enough details
1. 图遍历题，在一个社交网络里，要找从一个人到另一个人的路径
2.  数字转单词。有一个词表，和数字到字符的映射关系，需要为用户输入的数字串，推荐可能匹配的单词
   上面2题都来自于https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1032359-1-1.html
2. sorted int array, find max <= target; find max <= target in a BST
2. 1 sqrt. list of weights, find minimum truck load, so that all weight can be transported within x times
1. convert json to xml， div can be recursive
2. 开始以为是要很多很多的点组合在一起构成长方形，但其实是四个顶点就能构成长方形了。这边浪费了点时间，最后一轮了脑子也不清楚了，最后code也没写完。
3. 桶排序
4. Online assessment: given a vector v of  permuation from 1-n
return a vector where in each position i, it is the number of subarrays which mean is v[i]
挺死板的方法， 先把presum  算出来， 然后for(for) 算出所有possible subarrays  的mean.
